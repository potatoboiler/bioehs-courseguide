          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>The mission of Outreach Committee is to connect Berkeley Bioengineering with the greater community. We help committee members reach their full potential for effective scientific communication. Outreach Committee conducts targeted workshops dedicated to developing these skills in a personalized, supportive environment, showing committee members how to connect with any audience in a professional, timely yet impactful way. 
          <p>Through events like school visits, members have the opportunity to apply their learned skills: they firsthand empower and inspire future engineers by teaching them scientific concepts. In the process, Outreach Committee represents BioEHS, and Berkeley Engineering with every school visit.
          </p>

          <h2>For Applicants</h2>
            <p>
                Hello and welcome to the Outreach Committee!! The Outreach Committee focuses on giving back to the community and bringing your passions for bioengineering to audiences that may not otherwise be familiar with our field. Over the course of the semester, we will learn how to communicate to various audiences including high school and community college students. We will also learn about different outlets to volunteer and better the community around us through engineering and non-engineering channels. As a committee, we will host workshops on effective presentation, communication, and writing skills that will give you and other candidates the tools necessary to bring your exciting ideas to larger audiences. Don’t worry if presenting is not your forte! At times you may feel out of your comfort zone, but overall it will be a welcoming and accepting environment for everyone. By the end of the semester, I hope you will feel well equipped to light the way for future Bioengineers and feel as though you have given back to our community in an impactful way.

          <h2>BioE Day</h2>
          <p>BioE Day is an event hosted by Bioengineering Honor Society on UC Berkeley campus for high school scholars, especially those of underrepresented communities. Our goal is to present various interesting areas of bioengineering to help students answer the question "What is Bioengineering?"</p>
          <p>There will be several fun bioengineering-related hands-on activities, tours of on-campus laboratories, and demos to capture the students' interest, and excite them for participating in BioEHSC™ or BioE in general.</p>
          <p>The Third Annual Bioengineering Day will take place on November 16th, from 10 AM - 3:30 PM at Soda Hall. Lunch will be provided. Once we hit capacity, a waitlist will be applied, so make sure to  <a href={{bioe_day_rsvp_form}} target="_blank">RSVP!</a></p>
