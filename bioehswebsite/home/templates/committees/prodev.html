          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>The Professional Development committee, (Pro-Dev for short) is geared towards connecting BioE students with opportunities in industry, and hosting events that will prepare members for the professional world. The Pro-Dev Committee holds Linkedin/Resume, elevator-pitch, and technical interview workshops to help members develop networking skills, and committee members excercise those skills by connecting with BioEHS alumni through organizing networking events and mixers and working with other professionals from industry through arranging info-sessions. In the past, Pro-Dev has hosted infosessions for Teach for America, Keck Graduate Institute, Abbott, Verily, Life Technologies, Illumina, and more as well as BioEHS alumni panels co-hosted with the Academic Committee.
          </p>
          <h2>For Committee Members</h2>
          <p>
            The Professional Development Committee will be focused on aiding members expand their professional circle and develop the soft skills needed to succeed in their careers. We are aiming to host two primary events this semester that committee members will be heavily involved in planning: an industry externship and monthly coffee chats. This will give committee members the opportunity to see how each bioengineering concentration is incorporated into industry and help solidify their professional paths moving forward. Through helping organize these events, members will also gain networking experience and numerous industry contacts. Additionally, we will host 5 workshops from January to May with topics including networking, building a resume, perfecting your LinkedIn profile, filling out internship/job applications, and acing the behavioral/technical interviews. Being part of this committee will enable you to develop the necessary skills to succeed in industry while simultaneously helping out the bioengineering community here at Cal. We truly hope you decide to join us and look forward to working with you!
